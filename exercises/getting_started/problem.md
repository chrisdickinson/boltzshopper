# Welcome to Boltzmann!

Boltzmann is a Node.js HTTP framework with a peculiar set of values:

- Pay only for what you use
- You own your dependencies
- The framework should fall away when you don't need it

As such, it doesn't work like other frameworks: there's nothing to "npm
install"; no single dependency for boltzmann in `package.json`.

Instead, Boltzmann provides a CLI application for scaffolding projects, and
keeping your project up-to-date with the latest scaffold.

In this lesson, we'll start a new boltzmann application. Try it now! Run:

```
$ npx boltzmann-cli .
```

Then check your solution with `boltzshopper run .`. To move to the next lesson
run `boltzshopper verify .`.
