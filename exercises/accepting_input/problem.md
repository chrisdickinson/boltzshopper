# Accepting input

[[ introductory concepts ]]


This lesson created a scaffold for you in `./accepting-input/`. `cd` there now.

The scaffold project gives you three handlers for an in-memory book database. Implement `addBook()` to accept POST data, generate an ID for the new book, store the book in the databases, and respond with the ID.

// implement bookByID(), responding with 404 if the requested ID isn't found
// implement addBook(), responding with the ID
// implement validation for the http body in addBook()

Once you've implemented the handlers, use `boltzshopper run .` to check your work! If it looks like it
passed, run `boltzshopper verify .`.
