# :zap: Boltzshopper :zap:

A [workshopper](https://github.com/workshopper/workshopper-adventure) for learning
how to use [Boltzmann](https://github.com/entropic-dev/boltzmann/), a Node.JS HTTP
framework.

## Prerequisites

- Node 14+
- macOS or Linux
- Make sure you have docker installed and running
  - Linux users: make sure you can use [`docker` without `sudo`][docker-sudo]

Once you have these things in order, you can run `npm i -g boltzshopper`, then
run `boltzshopper` to get started! The workshop will scaffold per-exercise
directories for you. There's a brief pause when starting a lesson while we
install node modules for you.
